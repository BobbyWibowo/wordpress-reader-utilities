# WordPress Reader Utilities

> Migrated to [https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/userscripts](https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/userscripts).

Common utilities for readers of WordPress-based sites.

## Features

* Auto-detect WordPress-based sites (should work with both WordPress.com & WordPress.org).  
This may not work 100% of the time.
* Append published & modified dates underneath the post's title.
* Prepend a collapse/expand toggle button before the comments section (should work with both WordPress built-in comments & Disqus).  
Comments will be collapsed by default.

## To-do

* Currently none.
